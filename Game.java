/* 
Game Path:
Stuck in a labyrinth with pathways to choose from.

The labyrinth's map will be regenerated every run.

You get to choose what paths to take.

There is an exit that you see fairly early on. However, you
need to get a tool to break down the door.

But just when you find a tool, you can go back and use it.
